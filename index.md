```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // This for loop initializes an integer 'i' to 0,
    // runs as long as 'i' is less than 1000,
    // and increments 'i' by 1 after each loop.
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0; // Indicates the program ran successfully
}
